# Welcome to `recOrder`'s documentation

**I would like to install recOrder on my microscope:** start with the [setup guide](./setup-guide.md).

**I would like to use recOrder to analyze existing data:** start with the [installation instructions](./installation-instruction.md).

**I would like to watch an experienced user introduce `recOrder`**: [watch the tutorial](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tHLHZ_uUnddb3jzXnQUjUiynSDS8XIy2/view?usp=sharing). 

**I noticed an error in the documentation or code:** [open an issue](https://github.com/mehta-lab/recOrder/issues/new/choose) or [send us an email](mailto:shalin.mehta@czbiohub.org). We appreciate your help!
