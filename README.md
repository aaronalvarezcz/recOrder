# recOrder
This package offers a comprehensive pipeline, command line interface, and napari plugins for quantitative label-free microscopy.

In this repo you will find python tools and UI that allow the user to calibrate microscope hardware, acquire multi-modal data, reconstruct density and anisotropy, and visualize the data.

The acquisition, calibration, background correction, reconstruction, and applications of QLIPP are described in the following [E-Life Paper](https://elifesciences.org/articles/55502):

recOrder is to be used alongside the QLIPP module, whose design has been optimized to fit on a conventional widefield microscope (Panel A below).  The QLIPP module allows for the collection of label-free information consisting of the intrinsic anisotropy of the sample and its relative phase (density).  All of these measurements are collected through compensated, polarization diverse illumination and quantitatively recovered through recOrder's computational reconstruction pipeline.  The overall structure of recOrder can be visualized below in Panel B, highlighting the two different usage modes and their features: graphical user interface (GUI) through napari and command line interfact (CLI).

## Installation

### Create a new conda environment
Install conda package management system by installing anaconda or miniconda ([link](https://conda.io/)). 

1) Creating a conda environment dedicated to `recOrder` will avoid version conflicts among packages required by `recOrder` and packages required by other python software.
>```buildoutcfg
>conda create -n <your-environment-name> python=3.7
>conda activate <your-environment-name> (or source activate <your-environment-name>)
>```

2) Then, install jupyter notebook with
>```buildoutcfg
>conda install jupyter
>```

### Install `recOrder` and required packages
Install the git version control system git : [link](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

1) Use git to clone this repository to your current directory:
>```buildoutcfg
>git clone https://github.com/mehta-lab/recOrder.git
>```

2) Then, you can install dependencies via pip (python index package) <br>

>    If you are running recOrder on your own machine, <br>
>
>    a) navigate to the cloned repository:
>
>    ```buildoutcfg
>    cd recOrder
>    ```
>    <br>
>    b) install recOrder and dependencies:
>
>    ```buildoutcfg
>    pip install -e .
>    ```
>    <br>

*`recOrder` supports NVIDIA GPU computation through cupy package, please follow [here](https://github.com/cupy/cupy) for installation (check cupy is properly installed by ```import cupy```). To enable gpu processing, set ```use_gpu=True``` when initializing the simulator/reconstructor class.*

## Usage and example

In the following, we demonstrate how to run `recOrder` for reconstruction. <br>

1) In the terminal, switch to the environment with waveorder installed 
>  ```buildoutcfg
>  conda activate <your-environment-name>
>  ```

2) Navigate to the repository folder:
>  ```buildoutcfg
>  cd recOrder/example
>  ```

3) Open `config_example.yml` and modify the parameters to match your dataset:

3) Run reconstruction with the path to your config file
>  ```buildoutcfg
>  recOrder.reconstruct --config <path/to/config>
>  ```
